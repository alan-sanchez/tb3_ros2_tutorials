# ROS2 examples

This repo provides guides to get started on your ROS2 software development. Below are examples of nodes to have a Turtlebot3 perform simple tasks. Note, for these tutorials, I used a Turtlebot3 Burger. 

Before you get started with these tutorials, I recommend you complete the [Quick Start Guide](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/quick-start/) offered by [ROBOTIS](https://emanual.robotis.com/). I found it to be very helpful when setting everything up. 

1. [Teleoperate the Turtlebot with a Node](examples/teleoperate_tb3_with_node.md) - Use a python script that sends velocity commands.  
<!-- 2. [Filter Laser Scans](example_2.md) - Publish new scan ranges that are directly in front of Stretch.
3. [Mobile Base Collision Avoidance](example_3.md) - Stop Stretch from running into a wall.
4. [Give Stretch a Balloon](example_4.md) - Create a "balloon" marker that goes where ever Stretch goes.
5. [Print Joint States](example_5.md) - Print the joint states of Stretch.
6. [Store Effort Values](example_6.md) - Print, store, and plot the effort values of the Stretch robot. -->
